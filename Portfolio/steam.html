                                Steam is a digital games distribution platform created by Valve Corporation. In its current shape, the platform offers multiplayer gaming, digital rights management (DRM), social networking services, and video streaming to subscribers. It also provides the user with community features such as friends lists and groups, cloud storage, and in-game voice and chat functionality.

                                On Steam's mobile app, a majority of the primary actions are accessible through the hamburger menu which requires multiple taps to get to specific screens/options. With Steam being the largest distribution platform for PC gaming it’s time to define a new structure to the app.

                            Steam platform is the current leader when it comes to games distribution, they have more monthly active users than any of its competitors. Those competitors were examined and then their strengths and weaknesses were compared <b>to understand how Steam can develop a new structure to their application.</b>

                            While these competitors have IOS/ Android applications with a modern UI, 2 of the 3 mainly have it for their social network feature instead of a storefont. Although Epic does lack this feature, their app provides the user with a limited selection of free games that are only playable on mobile devices.
                            <br><br>
                            Xbox excels in providing both social features and the storefront on their mobile application. One of their downsides is that their storefront is more subscription based so unlike steam, they lack in the number of game titles they have on their storefront.

                            From the user insight, it showed that the Users who accessed the steam app were competitive and casual gamers. Competitive games tended to access the market more than causal players but overall a majority of them accessed the app to use their steam guard and buy games.

                                Due to the UI being dated, inspiration was taken from competitors which then allowed for a clean and modern UI layout to be designed. Next, a tab menu was implemented which would have the high level navigation system in the app. The hamburger menu would still exist but would house the secondary categories such as going through to the communities page, settings, etc. The cart, search feature and notifications would be located on the navigation tab for quick access. This makes it easy for the user to explore and switch between each category.

                                On the product page, there is a fixed button located above the tab menu which allows users to add to cart quickly and easily and takes them to their cart afterwards to view the product. This makes the payment process of purchasing their game title straightforward with no hassle.

                                Once the new design layout was implemented for the storefront and marketplace this allows users to go through each category without a hassle. The storefront allows for simple swipes to view the items listed in each category. Once the user gets to the end they have the option to view more to see what similar game titles would be recommended to them or they can continue to scroll through.

                                The market took inspiration from Twitch, the high categories screens to access are located below the navigation menu. A tab menu was then used to seamlessly explore between the listed items in those specific categories.

                            Being a game enthusiast, redesigning the steam application was a knowledgeable experience. Conducting different tests and gaining insights from these results helped with overcoming the challenge that these users were experiencing. Research is vital when trying to solve complex UX problems, without it, being able to pinpoint the problems would have been difficult and resulting in the redesign of the product to be a challenge and unsatisfying for the user. Researching is a must to have a successful product.
