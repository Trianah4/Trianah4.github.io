                            To start off, a few questions needed to be asked. Who is the dispensary owner? Who is the dispensary member? Why would a member be using this app? Are there any limits we need to work with?

                            The survey suggests that a majority of people who shop at dispensaries spend over $200+ every visit. With the SMS offers, they become enticed to shop more and save money on the brands they like and are allowed to try new products while saving money. This gives the customers a sense of being rewarded which allows these dispensaries to maintain customer retention.

                            While some of the customers like the way they receive their promotions/offers, others have a hard time using their rewards because they get buried in personal text messages, accidentally get deleted, or they forget when those offers expire.
                            <br><br>
                            From the insight, users also wanted a feature that would allow them to check in or scan for points right from the application.

                            Ethos was a learning curve, it was a market that I was unfamiliar with so producing an application was a challenge I enjoyed. I had very little knowledge of the cannabis industry but with the help of the client and research, I was able to understand their vision and the challenges for this project. If there was more time, more research and usability testing would uncover additional pain points and would lead us to make better design decisions. Overall, the value of research and planning produces findings in the most beneficial way to our users within our constraints.
