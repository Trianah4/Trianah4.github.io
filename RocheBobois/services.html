                                                        The charm, beauty and touch of the leathers developed exclusively for Roche Bobois are the result of processes performed in tanneries. These processes may be summarised by two main phases: the first phase is to transform the raw hide into a product that is healthy, soft, impenetrable, and durable. The second phase is to use the finishing processes to bring the final aesthetic of the hide (nourishing the leather, colouring treatments, applying dyes and surface improvements, etc.).
                                                        The hide is transformed into leather, and these processes bring all the features that drew you to your Roche Bobois furniture.

                                                        Tanning and finishing processes turn leather into a quality product. However, the tanning process does not erase imperfections in the leather.

                                                        Markings from the animal’s life in the pasture are marks of authenticity and are integrated into the leather. These markings are usually subtle and do not detract from the quality of the skin (layers of skin, stretch marks, healed wounds, insect bites).

Leather adapts to the constraints of its environment and often keeps some residual skin elasticity. This natural phenomenon, which is the same for leather used in clothing or other leather goods, varies in visibility depending on how intensely it is used, its environment (temperature, humidity, etc.), flexibility of the seats, and the thickness of the leather.

                                                        <br><br>
                                                        In order for you to fully enjoy your leather seating and ensure its longevity, we recommend you follow some basic rules.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Leather is sensitive to heat and light, even reflections, to varying degrees depending on the type of finishing. These factors can dry out the leather and dull the vibrancy of its colours.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        If possible, your seating should be arranged in a way to avoid direct exposure to the sun and moon, and should also not be placed too close to windows.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Do not place your seating near an intense heat source (fireplace, radiator, or other heating device).
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Observe and follow the care instructions to maintain the physical and aesthetic qualities of the leather.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Do not wait until the item is dirty to perform maintenance, and do not try to clean, remove stains, etc. without the proper products.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Leather is durable, but similar to woodwork or any other material, it is sensitive to physical harm that may affect its beautiful appearance (scratches from sharp objects or pets, friction from fabric or scratchy clothing, clothing rivets or buckles, etc.). Be sure to avoid this type of harm to the leather. Particular attention must be paid to some jeans, whose finishes may transfer their colours onto the leather, especially light leather, and which may be unfixable.

                                                        The amount of dust and dirt that collects on your leather is the same as what accumulates onto wooden furniture, which you dust off regularly because it is so visible.
                                                        To prevent dust that dulls your leather and gets wedged in the creases of the hide, make sure to dust weekly, especially if your sofa has a padded seat. Dust using a vacuum on the lowest setting with a soft brush tip, or by wiping a soft, moistened cloth across the leather surface.

                                                        Leather maintenance is essential to preserve the aesthetics and physical appearance of the leather for the near future. Maintenance should be done in two steps, four times per year:

                                                        This process removes all greasy or sticky dust as well as common marks and stains from use that are not removed by regular dusting. Cleaning also helps prepare the leather for applying the protective product, which is used on a clean surface. Cleaning first makes the product more efficient, as it must permeate or polymerise the leather surface, depending on its type of finishing.

                                                        This process properly protects the upholstery leather from all possible harm (protection against drying, stains, friction, and discolouration due to light). The protective product proactively creates a protective barrier against harm that may affect the leather. Respecting the maintenance frequency keeps a constant state of protection on the item and preserves its effectiveness.

                                                        Just like all textile materials (carpets, rugs, curtains, etc.) and depending on the nature of the fibres, your upholstery fabric may be more or less sensitive to light and heat. You should layout your living room furniture in a way that avoids direct exposure to the sun and moon and avoid placing furniture near a heat source, if possible.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Dust, the same dust that settles on your wood furniture, and substances from using seating (friction from clothes, hands, small accidental stains, etc.) are the prime factors that tarnish textiles and affect their appearance.
                                                        Do not wait for the marks that appear on the most exposed parts of your seating to get too pronounced before performing recommended maintenance.

                                                        This must occur regularly to remove dust that settles on the textile and is crushed into the fabric by using the seats.

                                                        Dust weekly using a very soft brush. Avoid hard brushes that may abrade the surface of the fabric and create a fibrillation effect (breaking of the textile yarn) and/or pilling.

                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Some fabrics in the Roche Bobois collection receive protective treatment during production, and all others can receive this treatment by requesting it at your Roche Bobois showroom.
                                                        The treatment prevents stains from penetrating the fabric and makes it easier to remove them.
                                                        For accidental and spot stains, carefully take care of them as soon as possible; don’t wait for the stains to soak in.

                                                        2. After a local test on a hidden or inconspicuous area of the leather, proceed with the stain removal by following the instructions of the different procedures.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Avoid rubbing the fabric. Dabbing the stain with a sponge and the effects from the products are sufficient.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Rubbing too hard can affect the textile fibre and harm its aesthetic appearance.

                                                        If the residue creates a halo, repeat the stain removal process (Procedure No. 1) while attempting to dry the textile: dab with a dry absorbent cloth or use a vacuum on the lowest setting with a soft brush nozzle attachment to remove as much moisture as possible before applying the stain removal absorbent powder. You can dry the moistened area faster by using a hair dryer in a circular motion, from the outside to the inside of the area needing to be dried. Avoid over-heating the fabric.

Repeat if necessary until you are satisfied with the result, but avoid soaking the fabric. Do not rub or scratch the stained area intensely to avoid altering the fabric.
                                                        After finishing the stain removal process and letting the stained area fully dry, sprinkle the moistened part with the stain removal absorbent powder to eliminate residue and prevent a halo. Let dry, then use a vacuum on the lowest setting with a soft brush nozzle attachment to prevent damaging the fibres of the fabric.

                                                        Just like all textile materials (carpets, rugs, curtains, etc.), the microfibres are sensitive to light and heat. You should layout your living room furniture in a way that avoids direct exposure to the sun and moon and avoid placing furniture near a heat source, if possible.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Dust, the same dust that settles on your wood furniture, and spots from using seating (rubbing from clothes, hands, small accidental stains, etc.) are the main factors that tarnish textiles and affect their appearance.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Do not wait for the marks that appear on the most exposed parts of your seating to get too pronounced before performing the recommended maintenance.

                                                        Roche Bobois sofas are designed with a solid wood structure (beech, poplar or fir wood), with additional reinforcing crossbars for the seats.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        Plywood or engineered composite wood panels help to strengthen each structure. Foam sheets of varying thicknesses allow flexibility between the structure and the exterior.

                                                        100% feather cushions. These cushions are made entirely out of feathers that have been sterilized at a high temperature. Segregated like a comforter to prevent the feathers from settling, they must regularly be “fluffed" to ensure their comfort and maintain the feathers natural “bounce”. The feathers tend to absorb moisture significantly, resulting in the cushion being significantly compressed. Four times per year, we recommended leaving the interior of the cushions outside, in the sun if possible (or, alternately, in the dryer on low heat), to force out moisture.

                                                        Feather and foam cushions. This is most commonly used by Roche Bobois in back cushions. They combine the comfort of feathers with the natural elasticity of foam. They are produced in two ways:
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        - The cushion base is made of foam surrounded by a quilted layer of feathers that have been sterilised at a high temperature.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        - Foam cubes are mixed with feathers and act like springs.

                                                        Foam cushions. Most of the seat cushions in our sofas are made of High Resilience bi or tri-density foam: the lower portion using a higher density (at least 30 kg/m3) for maximum support, and the upper portion using a lower density for cushioning comfort.
                                                        <br><br>
                                                        All foams need to be “broke in”, and optimum comfort will be obtained after two or three months of use.

                                                        Hygrometry consists of the level of humidity in the air. Humidity has a large impact on solid furniture. “Dry” woods are used during manufacturing, having a moisture content between 8-12%. However, wood is a living material and therefore subject to dimensional variations.

                                                        As with many materials, and despite the protective coating, exposure to light (UV rays from the sun or moon) can change the colours of solid wood and veneers. Light wood (cherry, etc.) naturally tends to darken, especially the first year. Dark wood may fade. However, reconstituted veneers (ALPI®) aren’t affected by UV rays.

                                                        We recommend using a 100% natural beeswax or carnauba wax. Apply the wax using brushes or steel wool No. 0000, and spread the layer of wax in the direction of the wood grain. Allow the wax to harden, then always rub with the grain to polish using a dry steel wool No. 0000 or dry cloth. This patina wax will bring back your furniture’s natural sheen.
                                                        Never use any solvents, products containing solvents, or aerosols.
